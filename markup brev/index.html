    <rub1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</rub1>
                 
    <p> <br/> Dear Eileen,<br/>

      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br/> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <Rub2>Starting dates<rb/><br/> </Rub2>
   
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br/> could start at the beginning of a semester;<br/></p>
    
    <item1>First semester: 9 September 2016</item1>
  </body>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br/></p>
  <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our <a href="http://www.patience-is-a-virtue.org/">website</a>. <br/><br/> </p>
  

  <rub3>Subjects of study<br/><br/></rub3>

    
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br/> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br/> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br/> by are as follows, in order of priority:<br/></p>

    <item2>   <OL>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol &#40; C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</li>
        
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#176;C (86&#176;F), when the<br/> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &#215; 103 increasing to 3 &#215; 104.) </li>
        
        <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </OL>    </item2>

    
    
 
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br/> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p> 
        
<rub4>Exotic dance moves</rub4>
    
    
    
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br/> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    
    
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p> 
    
        <d1>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whole village would dance around<br/> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</d1>
    
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    
        <d2>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br/> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br/> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br/> modern styles such as Twerking.</d2>
    
    

   <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    
      <d3>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br/> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br/> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br/> because they were really cold.</d3>
    

<p>For more of my research, see <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/">my exotic dance research page.</a><br/><br/>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>
Dr Eleanor Gaye<br/><br/>
